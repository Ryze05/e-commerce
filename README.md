## ⚙️ Development Logic (jQuery)

The `script.js` file handles the application's core functionality:
1.  **Modal Data Binding**: Automatically detects which product was clicked and populates the modal with the correct image, title, and price.
2.  **Cart Arithmetic**: Calculates subtotals and grand totals dynamically as items are added or removed.
3.  **Custom UI Plugins**: Features specialized jQuery functions like `.darkNav()` and `.lightNav()` to swap Bootstrap classes on the fly for theme management.
